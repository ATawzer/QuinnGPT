# QuinnGPT
Query Unreal Instantly with Nearest Neighbors - Library dedicated to serving the latest documentation on unreal, its source code, your source code and plugins with GPT powered embeddings and chat, served with ChromaDB.

# Introduction
With the power of GPT, unreal engine development has definitely acclerated greatly for many developers. The only downside is the training window stopped right before UE5. QuinnGPT, named after one of the two iconic mannequis that ship with UE5, solves this by providing an interface for scraping the latest docs into a chromadb vectorstore and then allowing chat-like interactions with the latest documentation. In Addition, the vector store can populate your own source code, custom plugins or other sources of documentation as needed.

# Getting Started
This is a work in progress, more to come. . .
